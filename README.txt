Introduction:
Our project aims to create an EDM (Electric Dance Music) song using the concepts of perceptibility, markov chains, and biasing randomness taught in CS1610 - Computing in the Arts

The contents of this director include:

FinalSong.m4a
A final version (with professional effects) of the tune generated by our Markov chain.

FinalMix.wav
A mix of our song with a few other songs actually created by professional musicians. Used to survey individuals to see if they could pick out the algorithmically created song from the others.

GeneratedMidi
This directory is where the program writes out the Midi Files it generates. 

MidiMelodies
This directory contains a training set of Midi files for popular EDM songs 

PROGRAM FILES
The following program files contain, in order, various iterations of the project.

read.py
A first iteration of the program. Reads in the database, generates a Markov Chain, and prints out the result.

readRelative.py
The next iteration, in which notes are considered by the Markov chain based on where they fall relative to eachother, rather then there actual tone.

structuredTwoState.py
An iteration that includes rests as well at notes. To make this work, the Markov chain had to be adapted to consider the last two states, instead of just the previous one. 

ReadRelativeStructured.py
The final program. Outputs a 4-beat long MidiFile that contains at least 10 elements (rests or notes)

markov
A markov chain database file created by the program. 

To run from Command Line:

"python readRelativeStructured.py"

A MidiFile will be created and stored in the "GeneratedMidi" directory!
